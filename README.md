# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly selects an option, and the winner is determined based on the traditional rules of the game.
